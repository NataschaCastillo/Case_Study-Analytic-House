# Capstone Project: Real Estate Price Analysis

## Overview

For my first Capstone project in the Strategic Thinking discipline, I have developed this assessment. The main objective was to assess my ability to apply project management methodology in order to effectively develop and execute a capstone project.

## Project Scope

I chose to work with data related to house prices in and around Seattle, Washington for this project. The tasks included:

- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Pre-processing the data
- Implementing at least one machine learning algorithm
- Presenting my findings through a comprehensive report.
